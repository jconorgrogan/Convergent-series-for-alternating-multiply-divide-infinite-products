# Interesting alternating prime series 

Was playing around with primes and stumbled upon this fusion of alternating series, which seems to have interesting convergence behavior- and for s=1 as well!

# Alternating Prime Euler Products

This document introduces **alternating (multiply–divide) infinite products** formed from the Euler factors of the Riemann zeta function. We describe:

1. How the usual Euler product arises and converges (or diverges).
2. Why introducing an alternating pattern of multiplication and division leads to new, seemingly convergent infinite products over the primes.
3. Concrete examples at \(s=1\) and \(s=2\), yielding numerical values that do not appear to match any known constants.


## 1. Background: Euler’s Product for \(\zeta(s)\)

Recall the **Riemann zeta function** for \(\Re(s) > 1\):

\[
\zeta(s) 
\;=\; 
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}
\;=\;
\prod_{p \,\text{prime}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^s}\right)^{-1}.
\]

In factor form:

\[
\zeta(s) 
\;=\;
\prod_{p \,\text{prime}}
\frac{p^s}{\,p^s - 1\,}.
\]

- For \(\Re(s) > 1\), this **converges absolutely**.  
- For \(s = 1\), \(\zeta(1)\) (the harmonic series) diverges, so \(\prod_{p}(1 - 1/p)^{-1}\) also diverges.

At **\(s = 2\)**, we get \(\zeta(2) = \pi^2 / 6 \approx 1.644934\ldots\).

## 2. Introducing an Alternating Multiply–Divide Pattern

### 2.1 Definition

Let \(p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < \dots\) be the increasing sequence of primes. Define the **reciprocal prime factor** for prime \(p_i\) and real \(s\) (\(\Re(s) > 0\)) as:

\[
F\bigl(p_i, s\bigr) 
\;=\;
\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_i^s}\right)^{-1} 
\;=\;
\frac{p_i^s}{\,p_i^s - 1\,}.
\]

In the *standard* product for \(\zeta(s)\), we multiply **all** such factors:

\[
\zeta(s) 
\;=\;
\prod_{i=1}^{\infty} F\bigl(p_i, s\bigr).
\]

Instead, we can introduce a pattern of multiplying some factors and dividing others. For example:

\[
\mathcal{P}_s
\;=\;
F_1 
\;\times\; 
F_2
\;\div\;
F_3
\;\times\;
F_4
\;\div\;
F_5
\;\times\;
F_6
\;\div\;\dots
\]
where \(F_i = F(p_i, s)\). Symbolically:

\[
\mathcal{P}_s 
\;=\;
\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}
F\bigl(p_k, s\bigr)^{\,\epsilon_k}
\quad\text{with}\quad
\epsilon_k \in \{ +1, -1 \}.
\]

### 2.2 Why Might It Converge or Diverge?

- **For \(s > 1\)**: Each factor \(F(p, s)\approx 1 + O(p^{-s})\). Since \(\sum_{p} p^{-s}\) converges for \(\Re(s) > 1\), any sign pattern (plus vs. minus in the exponent) remains absolutely convergent in log form. Thus, *any* systematic multiply–divide pattern **will converge** to *some* real constant (not necessarily \(\zeta(s)\)).

- **For \(s=1\)**: Normally, \(\prod_{p} (1 - 1/p)^{-1}\) diverges, mirroring the divergence of \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}\). However, an alternating multiply–divide arrangement *can* produce enough cancellations for a conditional convergence. Numerically, one finds that certain patterns appear to yield a stable value, even though the unaltered (all-multiplication) product diverges.

## 3. Concrete Examples

Recent numeric experimentation shows:

1. **At \(s = 2\)**, one particular simple pattern (e.g., multiply, multiply, then divide, etc.) yields a limit near **1.4636**, rather than \(\zeta(2)\approx1.6449\).  
2. **At \(s = 1\)**, despite the usual product diverging, the same multiply–divide scheme converges numerically to about **2.66847** when extended to millions of primes.

### 3.1 Example for \(s=2\)

- **Factors**: \(F(p,2) = \frac{p^2}{p^2 - 1} = (1 - 1/p^2)^{-1}\).  
- First few primes: \(2,3,5,7,11,\dots\). Then:
  \[
  F(2) = \frac{4}{3},\; F(3) = \frac{9}{8},\; F(5) = \frac{25}{24}, \dots
  \]
- Pattern: 
  \[
  \frac{4}{3}
  \;\times\;
  \frac{9}{8}
  \;\div\;
  \frac{25}{24}
  \;\times\;
  \frac{49}{48}
  \;\div\;\dots
  \]
- Numerics up to hundreds of thousands or millions of primes show a limit near **1.4636**.

### 3.2 Example for \(s=1\)

- **Factors**: \(F(p,1) = \frac{p}{p - 1} = (1 - 1/p)^{-1}\).  
- The product \(\prod_{p} \frac{p}{p - 1}\) over *all* primes diverges, but an alternating pattern (for instance, multiply the 1st factor, multiply the 2nd, divide the 3rd, etc.) converges numerically to about **2.66847**.

## 4. Interpretation & Open Questions

1. **Seemingly New Constants**:  
   These resulting limits do not match standard constants like \(\pi\), \(e\), or special values of \(\zeta(s)\). They appear to be new constructs, a direct outcome of the specific prime-based multiply–divide scheme.
2. **Conditional vs. Absolute Convergence**:  
   - For \(s>1\), \(\log(F(p, s))\approx 1/p^s\) which converges absolutely, so *any* sign pattern converges.  
   - For \(s=1\), \(\sum_{p} \log\bigl(F(p,1)\bigr)\) diverges (similar to \(\sum_{p} 1/p\)), but careful alternation in the exponents can yield a convergent rearrangement.
3. **No Known Closed Form**:  
   There is no known simplification or standard reference for these “alternating reciprocal prime products.” They represent genuine infinite products apparently not identified with classic constants.
4. **Further Study**:  
   One might attempt a rigorous convergence proof (e.g., bounding the partial sums of \(\pm\log(F(p,s))\)), or search for any deeper relationships to known constants. So far, none are evident.
