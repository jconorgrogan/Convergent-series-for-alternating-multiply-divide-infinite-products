Was playing around with primes and stumbled upon this fusion of alternating series, which seems to have interesting convergence behavior.

# Alternating Prime Euler Products

This document introduces **alternating (multiply–divide) infinite products** formed from the Euler factors of the Riemann zeta function. We describe:

1. How the usual Euler product arises and converges (or diverges).
2. Why introducing an alternating pattern of multiplication and division leads to new, seemingly convergent infinite products over the primes.
3. Concrete examples at \(s=1\) and \(s=2\), yielding numerical values that do not appear to match any known constants.

## 1. Background: The Euler Product for \(\zeta(s)\)

Recall the **Riemann zeta function** for \(\Re(s) > 1\):

\[
\zeta(s) 
= 
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}
= 
\prod_{p \text{ prime}} \bigl(1 - p^{-s}\bigr)^{-1}.
\]

In factor form:

\[
\zeta(s) 
= 
\prod_{p \text{ prime}}
\frac{p^s}{\,p^s - 1\,}.
\]

- For \(\Re(s) > 1\), this **converges absolutely**.  
- For \(s = 1\), \(\zeta(1)\) is the harmonic series (diverges), and thus 
  \(\prod_{p}(1 - 1/p)^{-1}\) also diverges.

At **\(s = 2\)**, we get the classic \(\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \approx 1.644934\ldots\).

## 2. Introducing an Alternating Multiply–Divide Pattern

### 2.1 Definition

Let \(p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < \dots\) be the increasing sequence of primes. Define the **Euler factor** for prime \(p_i\) and real \(s\) (\(\Re(s) > 0\)) as:

\[
F\bigl(p_i, s\bigr) 
= 
\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_i^s}\right)^{-1} 
= 
\frac{p_i^s}{\,p_i^s - 1\,}.
\]

In the *standard* product for \(\zeta(s)\), we multiply *all* such factors:
\[
\zeta(s) 
= 
\prod_{i=1}^{\infty} F\bigl(p_i, s\bigr).
\]

Instead, **we introduce a pattern** of multiplying some and dividing others. For example:

\[
\mathcal{P}_s
= 
F_1 
\times 
F_2
\div 
F_3
\times
F_4
\div
F_5
\times
F_6
\div
\cdots
\]
where \(F_i = F\bigl(p_i, s\bigr)\). Symbolically:

\[
\mathcal{P}_s 
= 
\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}
\Bigl(F\bigl(p_k, s\bigr)\Bigr)^{\epsilon_k},
\quad
\epsilon_k \in \{+1, -1\}.
\]

### 2.2 Why Might It Converge or Diverge?

- **For \(s > 1\)**: Each factor \(F(p, s)\approx 1 + O\bigl(p^{-s}\bigr)\). Since \(\sum_{p} p^{-s}\) converges for \(\Re(s) > 1\), any rearrangement (i.e., deciding to multiply or divide) still converges absolutely in the sense of the logs. Thus, *any* systematic multiply–divide pattern **will converge** to *some* real constant (though it may no longer be \(\zeta(s)\)).

- **For \(s=1\)**: Normally, \(\prod_{p} \bigl(1 - 1/p\bigr)^{-1}\) diverges, mirroring the harmonic series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/n\). However, an alternating multiply–divide arrangement *can* produce enough cancellations for a conditional convergence. Numerically, one finds that certain patterns appear to yield a stable product value, even though the unaltered (all-multiply) product diverges.

## 3. Concrete Examples

Recent numeric experimentation shows:

1. **At \(s = 2\)**, a simple pattern (e.g., multiply the 1st factor, multiply the 2nd, divide the 3rd, multiply the 4th, divide the 5th, etc.) yields a limit near **1.4636**, rather than \(\zeta(2)\approx 1.6449\).  
2. **At \(s = 1\)**, despite the usual product diverging, the partial products of the same multiply–divide scheme stabilize around **2.66847** when extended to millions of primes.

### 3.1 Example for \(s=2\)

- **Factors**: 
  \[
    F\bigl(p,2\bigr) 
    = 
    \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^2}\right)^{-1} 
    = 
    \frac{p^2}{\,p^2 - 1\,}.
  \]  
- First few primes: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots\). Then:
  \[
  F(2) = \frac{4}{3},\;\;
  F(3) = \frac{9}{8},\;\;
  F(5) = \frac{25}{24},\;\dots
  \]
- Pattern:
  \[
  \frac{4}{3}
  \;\times\;
  \frac{9}{8}
  \;\div\;
  \frac{25}{24}
  \;\times\;
  \frac{49}{48}
  \;\div\;\dots
  \]
- Numerics (up to hundreds of thousands or millions of primes) suggest a limit near **1.4636**.

### 3.2 Example for \(s=1\)

- **Factors**: 
  \[
    F\bigl(p,1\bigr) 
    = 
    \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)^{-1} 
    = 
    \frac{p}{\,p - 1\,}.
  \]
- The usual product \(\prod_{p} \frac{p}{p - 1}\) diverges, but if we alternate multiply/divide in a certain pattern, the resulting partial products converge numerically to about **2.66847**.

## 4. Interpretation & Open Questions

1. **New Constants**:  
   These limits appear to be *new* constants, not matching any well-known values (\(\pi\), \(e\), \(\zeta\)-values, etc.).

2. **Conditional vs. Absolute**:  
   - For \(s>1\), \(\sum p^{-s}\) converges absolutely, so any sign pattern in the exponent (multiply vs. divide) leads to convergence.  
   - For \(s=1\), the sum \(\sum 1/p\) diverges, but evidently some carefully chosen sign patterns can yield convergent rearrangements.

3. **No Known Closed Form**:  
   There is no known simplification or standard name for these specific infinite products. They appear to define new prime-based constants.

4. **Further Study**:  
   One might attempt a deeper analysis, bounding partial sums \(\sum \pm \log F(p,s)\) or searching for relationships to known constants. Nothing conclusive is yet known.

## 5. Conclusion

By **introducing a systematic multiply–divide pattern** into the **prime Euler factors** for \(\zeta(s)\), we can form infinite products that:

- Converge to new constants (e.g., around **1.4636** for \(s=2\)),
- And even converge for \(s=1\) (where the standard product diverges), around **2.66847** in one observed pattern.

These **Alternating Prime Euler Products** illustrate how prime-based infinite products can exhibit a variety of convergence behaviors once we allow sign patterns (multiply vs. divide). They seem to define genuine new constants in analytic number theory, with no known closed forms.
